## Problem Statement

In a time of overt hostility to climate goals at the federal level, state regulation is critical to confronting the climate crisis in the US. Electricity generation produces 28% of overall US greenhouse gas emissions and the need to transition to zero-emissions generation is manifest. Fortunately, energy generation is regulated at the statel level. Numerous states have established mandates for zero-emission energy generation, but there is resistance to such targets in many states, due in part to a perceived high cost of low emissions. In this project I will explore state electricity generation profiles over the period of 1990 - 2018, during which wind and solar power emerged from niche technologies to mainstream, cost-effective forms of electricity generation. I will use unsupervised clustering algorithms to gain insight into how geography, state policy, and the cost of fuels influence the states' journey toward a sustainable electricity grid, and how that journey has impacted retail electricity rates over time.

## Executive Summary

Renewable generation in the US consists of hydroelectric, wind, solar, biomass, and geothermal. The Energy Information Administration provides annual reporting of how electricity consumed at the state level (including Washington, DC) is generated, as well as average electricity rates data. We use this data to visualize each state's electricity generation and pricing profile over the entire 1990 - 2018 reporting period. Both K-Means and DBSCAN clustering algorithms are used to gain insight into how state geography and policy have influenced generation profile. 

### Data Gathering

Detailed [state generation profile data](https://www.eia.gov/electricity/data/state/) used in this project is from the Energy Information Administration. [Solar](https://www.nrel.gov/gis/solar.html) and [wind](https://www.nrel.gov/gis/wind.html) resource data is from the National Renewable Energy Laboratory.

### **[Capstone, Part 3: Progress Report + Preliminary Findings](./part_03/)**

In Part 3, you'll create a progress report of your work in order to get feedback along the way. Describe your approach, initial results, and any setbacks or lessons learned so far. Your report should include updated visual and statistical analysis of your data. Youâ€™ll also meet with your local instructional team to get feedback on your results so far!

- **Goal**: Discuss progress and setbacks, include visual and statistical analysis, review with instructor. [Submit your progress update on this form.](https://forms.gle/ci7maWp4G5wRHdwH8)
- **Due**: TBD

### **[Capstone, Part 4: Report Writeup + Technical Analysis](./part_04/)**

By now, you're ready to apply your modeling skills to make machine learning predictions. Your goal for Part 4 is to develop a technical document (in the form of Jupyter notebook) that can be shared among your peers.

Document your research and analysis including a summary, an explanation of your modeling approach as well as the strengths and weaknesses of any variables in the process. You should provide insight into your analysis, using best practices like cross validation or applicable prediction metrics.

- **Goal**: Detailed report and code with a summary of your statistical analysis, model, and evaluation metrics.
- **Due**: TBD

### **[Capstone, Part 5: Presentation + Recommendations](./part_05/)**

Whether during an interview or as part of a job, you will frequently have to present your findings to business partners and other interested parties - many of whom won't know anything about data science! That's why for Part 5, you'll create a presentation of your previous findings with a non-technical audience in mind.

You should already have the analytical work complete, so now it's time to clean up and clarify your findings. Come up with a detailed slide deck or interactive demo that explains your data, visualizes your model, describes your approach, articulates strengths and weaknesses, and presents specific recommendations. Be prepared to explain and defend your model to an inquisitive audience!

- **Goal**: Detailed presentation deck that relates your data, model, and findings to a non-technical audience.
- **Due**: TBD
